Challenge #3: Supervisor View (Final Level)

Create another Node app called bamazonSupervisor.js. Running this application will list a set of menu options:



View Product Sales by Department
Create New Department



When a supervisor selects View Product Sales by Department, the app should display a summarized table in their terminal/bash window. Use the table below as a guide.





department_id
department_name
over_head_costs
product_sales
total_profit




01
Electronics
10000
20000
10000


02
Clothing
60000
100000
40000





The total_profit column should be calculated on the fly using the difference between over_head_costs and product_sales. total_profit should not be stored in any database. You should use a custom alias.
If you can't get the table to display properly after a few hours, then feel free to go back and just add total_profit to the departments table.



Hint: You may need to look into aliases in MySQL.
Hint: You may need to look into GROUP BYs.
Hint: You may need to look into JOINS.
HINT: There may be an NPM package that can log the table to the console. What's is it? Good question :)

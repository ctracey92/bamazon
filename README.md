* About
A mock amazon app that runs via node in your console. The app has 3 levels to it: customer, manager, and supervisor, each with their own functions.
* In order to run this program you will need to do a few things first:
    * First create a package file by running the comman `npm init -y`
    * Install the [MYSQL] pakcage (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)
    * Afterwards install the [console.table] package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table)
* Now we are ready to run the application!
    - The customer file when run will display the items in inventory and ask the client which item they would like to buy, and how many. If there is enough inventory it will purchase it and tally up their total. If not it will respond with an error message.
    - The manager will allow the client to view inventory, view low inventory, add inventory to an exisiting product, and lastly to add a new product.
    - The supervisor view allows the client to create a new department, and to view the statistics of the current departments.

* Objective
    - The main point of this objective is to demonstrate the mastery of MYSQL queries in NODE. 

* Approach
    - Each level was first sketched out and psedo coded. 
    - Following that I began by setting up and seeding the database, and running the queries first in the work bench to make sure the syntax was right.
    - Following that I created the prompt functions in the JS file, and added in the MYSQL queries as functions to be run.
    - After that I tested to check for bugs and refactored as need be.
